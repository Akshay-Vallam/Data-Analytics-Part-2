# Data Warehouse and Analytics Project

This is a 2 part project which demonstrates a comprehensive data warehousing (Part 1) and analytics solution (Part 2), from building a data warehouse to generating actionable insights.

The Data Analytics (Part 2) of the Data Warehouse and Analytics project includes a comprehensive collection of SQL scripts for data exploration, analytics, and reporting. These scripts cover various analyses such as database exploration, measures and metrics, time-based trends, cumulative analytics, segmentation, and more.

This repository contains SQL queries designed to help **Data Analysts and BI Professionals** explore, segment, and analyze data within a relational database quickly. Each script focuses on a specific analytical theme and demonstrates best practices for SQL queries.
